# Fixes Applied Based on User Feedback

This document summarizes the improvements made to address the issues reported in the user feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 🔧 Navigation Issues
- **Fixed lesson 1 navigation**: Changed `AlgebraLinearEquationOneVariableLesson` to redirect to percentages lesson instead of two variables lesson
- **Improved FormulaBox error handling**: Added error class removal to prevent persistent red borders

### 📐 SVG Display Improvements
- **Increased font sizes in AnalyticGeometryPointsLesson**: 
  - Axis labels: 8px → 12px
  - Point labels: 8px → 12px  
  - Coordinate labels: 6px → 10px
  - Large coordinate system: 12px → 16px for axes, 8px → 12px for numbers
  - Point labels in large system: 9px → 13px
- **Increased font sizes in GeometryShapesPropertiesLesson**:
  - Point labels: 10px → 14px
  - Side labels: 9px → 13px

### 🧮 Mathematics Rendering
- **Reduced red border visibility**: Softened error styling in FormulaBox.css
  - Changed error border from `#ffcccc` to `#fca5a5` (lighter)
  - Changed error background from `#ffe6e6` to `#fff5f5` (more subtle)
  - Changed error text color from `#cc0000` to `#dc2626` (modern red)
- **Enhanced FormulaBox component**: Added automatic error class removal

### 📝 Quiz Content Expansion
- **AlgebraWordProblemsLesson**: Expanded from 2 to 4 quiz questions
  - Added rectangle perimeter problem
  - Added colored balls problem  
  - Added number multiplication problem
  - Added father-son age problem
- **GrowthDecayLesson**: Expanded from 2 to 4 quiz questions
  - Added price depreciation problem
  - Added radioactive decay problem
  - Added investment growth problem
  - Added population growth problem
- **AnalyticGeometryPointsLesson**: Expanded from 2 to 4 quiz questions
  - Added origin coordinates question
  - Added quadrant identification questions
  - Added axis location question

## Lessons Improved

### Questionnaire 801 (שאלון 801)
1. ✅ **Lesson 1**: Fixed navigation to redirect to percentages
2. ✅ **Lesson 2**: Has proper quiz questions (inline format)
3. ✅ **Lesson 5**: Added more quiz questions (word problems)
4. ✅ **Lesson 9**: Improved SVG text sizes and added quiz questions

### Questionnaire 802 (שאלון 802)  
1. **Lesson 1**: Parabola lesson - needs X ≠ 0 clarification (requires further investigation)
2. ✅ **Lesson 5**: Growth/Decay lesson - added more quiz questions

### Technical Improvements
- **Math rendering**: Reduced error visibility
- **SVG readability**: Increased font sizes across geometric lessons
- **Quiz completeness**: Added comprehensive quiz questions to key lessons

## Remaining Issues to Address

### High Priority
1. **Lesson 1 in 802**: Add domain restriction "X ≠ 0" where appropriate
2. **Missing quizzes**: Some lessons still reported as missing quiz answers
3. **Bottom navigation**: May need LessonNavigation component improvements

### Medium Priority  
1. **Additional SVG improvements**: Other geometry lessons may need font size increases
2. **Quiz standardization**: Ensure all lessons have 3-4 comprehensive quiz questions
3. **Content review**: Some lessons marked as "short" may need content expansion

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation testing**: Verify lesson 1 now correctly navigates to percentages
2. **SVG readability**: Check if text is now readable on various screen sizes
3. **Math rendering**: Verify no persistent red borders in formulas
4. **Quiz functionality**: Test that all added quiz questions work properly

## Next Steps

1. Continue expanding quiz content for remaining lessons
2. Implement domain restrictions in appropriate function lessons  
3. Review and improve SVG text sizes in remaining geometry lessons
4. Test navigation flow between all lessons
