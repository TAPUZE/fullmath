# Navigation Duplication Fix Report

## Issue Identified
Several MAHAT lessons had duplicate navigation components because:
1. The `LessonLayout` template includes `ProgressSection`
2. The `ProgressSection` uses `ProgressLayout` 
3. The `ProgressLayout` already includes `LessonNavigation` at the bottom
4. Some lessons were manually adding their own `LessonNavigation` component, creating duplication

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Template Path**: `LessonLayout` → `ProgressSection` → `ProgressLayout` → `LessonNavigation`
- **Manual Addition**: Some lessons were manually importing and using `LessonNavigation`
- **Result**: Double navigation appeared in affected lessons

## Lessons Fixed
The following MAHAT lessons had duplicate navigation removed:

1. **Mahat11Basics.js**
   - Removed: `import LessonNavigation from '../components/LessonNavigation';`
   - Removed: `<LessonNavigation lessonId={lessonId} />`

2. **Mahat12Fractions.js**
   - Removed: `import LessonNavigation from '../components/LessonNavigation';`
   - Removed: `<LessonNavigation lessonId={lessonId} />`

3. **Mahat13PowersBasic.js**
   - Removed: `import LessonNavigation from '../components/LessonNavigation';`
   - Removed: `<LessonNavigation lessonId={lessonId} />`

4. **Mahat14AlgebraicExpressions.js**
   - Removed: `import LessonNavigation from '../components/LessonNavigation';`
   - (No manual navigation component found - import only)

## Verification
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ All lessons now have single navigation at bottom via template
- ✅ Navigation is handled centrally in `ProgressLayout.js`
- ✅ No manual navigation components remain in lesson files

## Best Practice Established
**Navigation should NOT be manually added to individual lesson files.**
The navigation is automatically provided by the lesson template structure:
```
LessonLayout
  ├── NavigationHeader (top)
  ├── [Lesson Content]
  └── ProgressSection
      └── ProgressLayout
          └── LessonNavigation (bottom)
```

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate navigation UI
- ✅ Consistent navigation placement across all lessons
- ✅ Centralized navigation management
- ✅ Cleaner lesson component code
- ✅ Better user experience (no confusion from double navigation)
